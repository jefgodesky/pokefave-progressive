# PokéFave
Progressive Enhancement Version

The assignment: create a webpage that lists the Pokémon from [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and let users mark their favorites. I originally did this as a [React project](https://github.com/jefgodesky/pokefave-react), so a side-by-side comparison of what it would look like as a modern example of [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement) seemed like something that could be useful and interesting.
